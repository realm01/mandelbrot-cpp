Mandelbrot
----------
This is an implementation of the Mandelbrot set in C++.

In the `CPU` folder you find an implementation which uses the CPU for the math (and 16 threads). And in the `GPU` directory you find an implementation which uses the graphics card to compute the mandelbrot set. (Using a fragment shader written in the GLSL language)

To compile it have a look at `compile.txt`.
